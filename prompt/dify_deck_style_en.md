# Dify Deck Visual Style Prompt (English)

Design a minimalist, editorial-style slide deck for an AI infrastructure brand called **Dify**.

## Brand & Color

- Use **Dify Blue `#0033FF`** as the primary brand color (Pantone color).
- Combine mainly with **pure white** and **black**.
- Other colors may appear inside photos or technical diagrams, but must not visually overpower Dify Blue.
- Avoid gradients and rainbow effects. Keep the palette clean and limited.
- Use Dify Blue as solid bands, full-width bars, or large blocks (top / bottom bars, section headers, highlight blocks).

## Typography

- Bold, geometric **sans-serif** typeface.
- Headlines: very large, sometimes ALL CAPS, tight line spacing, left-aligned.
- Body text: smaller, clean, highly readable, short paragraphs or concise bullet points.
- Strong contrast between huge titles and small supporting text.

## Layout System

- Strict grid, generous whitespace, very few elements per slide.
- Fixed header–footer layout on every slide:
  - **Top right**: Dify logo.
  - **Bottom left**: deck / author / section label (e.g. “Pitch Deck”, “Speaker: Peter Han”).
  - **Bottom center**: copyright line (e.g. “Copyright © Dify Tech Inc. All Rights Reserved.”).
  - **Bottom right**: year and page number or date.
- Main content (headline, text, images, diagrams) sits in a clean central grid above the footer bar.
- Prefer compositions with **one big headline + one dominant visual (photo or diagram) + minimal text**.

## Imagery – General

- High-contrast, cinematic photos.
- Black-and-white and color photos are both allowed.
- If images are in color, keep them simple and tasteful (muted tones or single-color dominance), so **Dify Blue `#0033FF`** remains the strongest accent in the overall layout.
- Themes: tactile textures, close-ups (skin, braille dots, fabric), abstract objects, cinematic stills, metaphorical scenes about AI, intention, human–machine interaction, and infrastructure.

## Imagery – Engineering / Technical Training Slides

- For engineering or technical training topics (architecture, deployment, performance, workflows, APIs, DevOps, etc.), use slides with **colorful schematic diagrams**, such as:
  - system / infrastructure architecture diagrams
  - service topology diagrams
  - data-flow or sequence diagrams
  - component breakdowns, UI wireframes
  - code blocks or call-flow diagrams
- Diagrams may use multiple accent colors to distinguish components, services, layers, or data paths, while:
  - keeping the background white,
  - keeping lines and labels clean and readable,
  - using **Dify Blue `#0033FF`** as the primary brand color for titles, key lines, callouts, and highlights.
- Supporting colors should feel technical and professional (muted greens, oranges, grays, etc.), not playful or neon.
- Technical slides still follow the same grid, header–footer layout, whitespace, and typography as the rest of the deck.

## Key Slide Types (Layout Patterns)

- **Title / opener slide**: large Dify logo, stacked headline, optional small description or confidentiality line.
- **Concept / story slide**: bold heading + short bullets / paragraph + one strong photo.
- **Engineering / architecture slide**: heading + central diagram + short explanatory bullets.
- **Thank-you slide**: huge “THANK YOU!” on the left + contact info and a black-and-white QR code on the right.

## Overall Tone

- Bold, confident, calm, premium.
- Feels like a designed editorial layout, not a generic corporate template.
- No icons, no complex illustrations, no gradients—only rectangles, text, Dify Blue, controlled accent colors in diagrams, and strong photography.
